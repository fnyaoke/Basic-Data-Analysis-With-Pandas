# Basic-Data-Analysis-With-Pandas
Data Analysis and Visualization with Pandas & Matplotlib
üéØ Objective

Load and explore a dataset using pandas.
Perform simple data analysis to uncover insights.

Create visualizations with matplotlib to better understand the data.

Shows data wrangling, descriptive statistics, and visualization.

The file contains:

Data loading and exploration steps.
Basic data analysis results.
Visualizations (at least four).
Key findings or observations.

The Tasks performed by this code
Task 1: Load and Explore the Dataset

Select a dataset in CSV format (examples: Iris dataset, sales dataset, etc.).
Load the dataset using pandas.
Use .head() to preview the first few rows.
Inspect structure: check data types and identify missing values.
Clean the dataset by filling or dropping missing values.

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

Compute basic statistics (mean, median, std) using .describe().
Perform grouping on a categorical column and calculate the mean of a numerical column for each group.
Identify patterns or interesting insights in the dataset.

Task 3: Data Visualization

Create at least four visualizations with matplotlib:
Line chart ‚Äì trends over time (e.g., sales data).
Bar chart ‚Äì comparison of numerical values across categories (e.g., average petal length per species).
Histogram ‚Äì distribution of a numerical column.

Scatter plot ‚Äì relationship between two numerical variables (e.g., sepal length vs. petal length).

The Charts are enhanced with:

Titles
Axis labels
Legends (where appropriate)

‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
pip install pandas matplotlib

How to Run

Clone or download this project.
Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) or run the Python script (.py) in your environment.
Follow the steps to see the data exploration, analysis, and visualizations.

Example Findings (for Iris dataset)

Average petal length differs significantly across species.

Sepal length and petal length are positively correlated.

Histograms reveal normal-like distribution in some features.
